> possible to edit the context after compact? 

● claude-code-guide(Check compact context editing)
  ⎿  Done (3 tool uses · 36.7k tokens · 11s)                               

● No, you can't directly edit the compacted context after it's created.

  Options you have:

  1. PreCompact hook - Inject content before compaction via additionalContext in hook output
  2. Custom compact instructions - Pass instructions when compacting:
  /compact Remember to preserve X and Y details
  3. After compaction - Use /memory to add persistent context that carries forward

  The compacted summary is immutable once created - you'd need to start fresh or use the above workarounds to influence what's preserved.

> I can always export the conversation, does that include the compacted 
summary? 

● claude-code-guide(Check export includes summary)
  ⎿  Done (4 tool uses · 26.1k tokens · 41s)                               

● There's no built-in /export command yet (it's a pending feature request: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/2887).

  What you can access:

  Conversation data is stored in ~/.claude/projects/. You can extract it with tools like https://github.com/ZeroSumQuant/claude-conversation-extractor.

  Whether the compacted summary is preserved depends on timing - after compaction, the summary replaces the original messages in the active context. The raw conversation logs may still contain the full history, but I'd need to check the actual storage format to confirm.

  Were you thinking of a specific export method, or exploring options?
